Small appointment management app

To run the project, first create a virtual environment:
```
$ python3.7 -m venv venv
```

Activate virtualenvironment:
```
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

Enter Django's project folder:
```
$ cd scheduler
```

Run development server:
```
(venv) $ python manage.py runserver
```

Currently, the only working route is the Swagger UI.
